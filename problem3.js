    PROBLEM 3

    By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

    3
    7 4
    2 4 6
    8 5 9 3

    That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

    Find the maximum total from top to bottom of the triangle below:

    75
    95 64
    17 47 82
    18 35 87 10
    20 04 82 47 65
    19 01 23 75 03 34
    88 02 77 73 07 63 67
    99 65 04 28 06 16 70 92
    41 41 26 56 83 40 80 70 33

    (!) As there are only 16384 routes, it is possible to solve this problem by trying every route.
